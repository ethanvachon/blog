Every time I finished a function, I had five more ideas for other things I wanted to implement. The checkpoint for this week is especially exciting, building a functioning game is extremely rewarding to me, compared with the static site clone of last week.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=a.exports}}]);
